# Mithril Fractals

Mithril.js adaptation of [this React demo](https://github.com/Swizec/react-fractals)

[Live Demo](http://www.spacejack.ca/mithril-fractals/)

Obviously this is hardly the most efficient way to render a fractal animation, however it is an interesting rendering performance test of vdom (or other DOM) frameworks.
